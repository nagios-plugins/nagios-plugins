   The output can be the square of the largest uintmax_t, so double
   its size before converting to a bound.
   log10 (2.0) < 146/485.  Add 1 for integer division truncation.
   Also, the output can have a thousands separator between every digit,
   so multiply by MB_LEN_MAX + 1 and then subtract MB_LEN_MAX.
   Append 1 for a space before the suffix.
